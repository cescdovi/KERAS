# KERAS LEARNING PROJECT
This project is designed as a comprehensive guide to learning and mastering the Keras API through practical examples. Keras is a powerful and user-friendly deep learning framework, enables efficient building, training, and deployment of neural networks. 

 This project is constantly evolving, with new content and examples added regularly to keep it up to date and comprehensive.
 
## OBJECTIVES

- Understanding the keras layers and their parameters
- Understanding preprocessing methods
- Implement regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and improve generalization
- Fine-tune models: adapt them for new tasks
